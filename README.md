# Adaptive Precision using Framer Motion

This project is a **recreation** of Rauno Freiberg's awesome ["Adaptive Precision" prototype](https://rauno.me/craft/adaptive-precision). It caught my eye, and I thought it would be a fun challenge after taking Emil Kowalski's [Animations on the web course](https://animations.dev/). Huge thanks to Emil for the great course!

## What's this?

This is just my spin on Rauno's adaptive precision using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), pushing what I've learned in the course mentioned above.
